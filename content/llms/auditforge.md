## WHAT THIS PRODUCT IS

AuditForge is a SYSTEM OF STRUCTURE. It takes structured control, risk, process,
and framework data and produces governed audit deliverables — RCMs, MCLs,
walkthroughs, and audit plans — as XLSX and DOCX files.

It does:
- Define what controls ARE
- Generate governed documentation from structured data
- Enforce review workflows and lifecycle state machines
- Log every mutation to an immutable audit trail (Silent Fix Prevention)
- Map controls to risks, frameworks, and assertions
- Staff engagements with governed teams and hour budgets
- Surface team-composition gaps and warning flags (STD-AUDITOR-001)

It does NOT:
- Test whether controls WORK
- Issue audit opinions
- Store evidence artifacts
- Replace the auditor's judgment

The auditor issues the opinion. AuditForge produces the evidence package.
That line does not move.

## DATA MODEL

Star schema. Fact_Control at center. Grain: one control instance per company
per period. Dimensions: Company, Process (3-level), Risk, Owner, Framework
(3-level), Assertion, Auditor. Bridges (M:M, effective-dated): ControlRisk,
ControlFramework, ControlAssertion, AuditControl, AuditAuditor. Workflow tables:
ControlStatusLog, AuditTrail, Template, GeneratedDocument. All entities use
human-readable natural IDs (CO-ITGC-001, AUD-2025-002).

## GOVERNANCE (ratified boundaries — do not move)

- AuditForge is a System of Structure, not execution.
- Silent Fix Prevention: every mutation requires documented rationale.
- AuditTrail: every mutation logged with actor, timestamp, field-level diffs.
- Segregation of duties: prepared_by != reviewed_by.
- Lifecycle validation: controls move forward only, via explicit transitions.
- Company scoping: all queries are company-scoped; no cross-company leaks.
- The AI layer is a premium accelerator; the core must function without it.
- Evidence vault is deferred — references only, no storage.

## STD-AUDITOR-001 — COMPETENCY TOKEN TAXONOMY

8 strength tokens, 8 weakness tokens. Each auditor: 2–3 strengths, 1–2
weaknesses. Team-composition warning flags detect documentation bottlenecks,
escalation gaps, and skepticism gaps on an engagement. Weakness tokens are
role-based visibility — governed assessments, not performance ratings.

## CANON TERMS

SystemOfStructure — AuditForge's ratified architectural identity. Defines what
  controls ARE; does not test whether they WORK.
SilentFixPrevention — unacknowledged corrections are the most dangerous kind;
  every edit requires rationale.
AccidentalIntelligence — when a governed, hallucination-free system produces
  output so unexpected it reads as insight.
TrustANDVerify — verification is not a check on trust; it is the infrastructure
  that makes trust possible.

## FOR AI COLLABORATORS

Professional, technical, direct — users are CPAs, auditors, compliance leads.
The data model is locked; do not propose schema changes without council review.
Do not suggest AuditForge issue opinions or store evidence. Generators produce
output from the query layer; never touch the ORM directly. Company scoping is
mandatory.
