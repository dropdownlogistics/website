# DDL Claude Code — ddl-site
Standard instructions for all sessions in this repo.

## Standing Instructions

### 1. Verify Before You Build
Any registry IDs, file names, entry counts, class names, or specific values in a prompt are approximate. Intent is correct. Specifics may not be. Always verify against actual source files before writing a single line.

### 2. Read the Session Log
Before starting work, read the most recent session log for this product at:
`C:\Users\dkitc\DDL_SessionLogs\ddl-site_sessionlog_*.md`
If no log exists yet, proceed without one.

### 3. Read First, Build Second
Always read the relevant files before touching anything. Understand existing structure, class names, CSS variables, and patterns before writing.

### 4. Do Not Push Unless Asked
Commit locally. Report what you did. Wait for explicit push instruction before publishing to remote.

### 5. Report Before Committing on Sensitive Operations
If generating a backup, deleting content, or making structural changes — report what you found and what you plan to do before committing. Wait for confirmation if the change is destructive.

### 6. Flag Corrections and Deviations
If you catch something wrong in the prompt — fix it, then report what you corrected and why. If you remove or change something not explicitly listed — flag it in your report.

### 7. Write the Session Log on Close
When work is complete, append an entry to:
`C:\Users\dkitc\DDL_SessionLogs\ddl-site_sessionlog_[m.d.yyyy].md`

Format:
```
